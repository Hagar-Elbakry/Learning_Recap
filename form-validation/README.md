## Features

- **Form Fields:** Includes fields for user input (e.g., text, password, email, number, radio button).
- **Validation:** Performs server-side validation to ensure data integrity (e.g., required fields, username format, password format, email format).
- **Error Handling:** Displays error messages for invalid input.

## File Structure

- **index.php:** Contains PHP validation code.
- **TestData.php:** Additional PHP function for validation.

## How to Run the Form Validation

### Requirements

or a hosting service that supports PHP.

### Steps

1. **Download the Files:**
   - Download the form-validation files from this repository.
2. **Set Up local Server:**
    - If you are using a local server like XAMPP:
        - Copy the PHP files into the `htdocs` folder.
        - Start the Apache from the control panel of the tool.
3. **Open the Form:**
     - Open your web browser and navigate to the following URL:
